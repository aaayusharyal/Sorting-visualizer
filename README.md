# Sorting-visualizer
This is a minimalistic yet feature-rich web-based sorting visualizer built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to visually explore and understand various sorting algorithms in action. The tool is fully responsive, includes a dark/light theme toggle, and provides an algorithm code snippet in C++ for the last executed sort.
